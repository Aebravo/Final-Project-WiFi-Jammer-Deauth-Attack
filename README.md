# Final-Project-WiFi-Jammer-Deauth-Attack

For the final project, I wanted to include all devices acquired throughout the course and put them to use (raspberry pi, kali linux, wireless card with packet injection capabilities).

I will be presenting a WiFi jamming python script which continuously identifies all access points and their respective clients on channels 1-11, sends deauthentication packets and kicks them off the network.
